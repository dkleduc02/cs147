## SmartSustain Building
This project simulates a smart home system, activating lights when motion is detected and adjusting the temperature based on a predefined constant.

## Installation and Setup
This project requires the installation of matplotlib and pandas for our Python data visualization script. To show the visualizations, first you need to download the csv file from AWS (shown in the demo). Then you will need to have the data.csv file in the same directory as the Python script. Then, run the script and the visualizations should show up (all of this shown in the demo).
